et’s design a single repo that can run as either Parameter Server (PS) or Worker (via a flag), supports very frequent asynchronous updates (every 1–3 samples), keeps things efficient, and can report progress to your existing Django DB.

Below is a project plan + file structure + on-wire contracts + algorithms. No code yet — just the blueprint we’ll implement file-by-file together.

🧭 Goals (vs the TF PS baseline you shared)

Faster, more frequent sync: micro-steps of 1–3 samples (configurable).

Async but controlled staleness: workers never drift far—bounded staleness (SSP) + versioning.

Centralized optimizer state (PS applies gradients): avoids diverging Adam/SGD states on workers.

Delta/gradient compression: send sparse/quantized deltas to keep LAN traffic low.

Push-first propagation: PS streams new weights to workers (WebSocket/gRPC stream), not only pull.

Quorum aggregation: PS aggregates when K of N updates arrive or timeout, whichever first.

Even dataset sharding by PS via HTTP file list.

PostgreSQL reporting (same DB Django uses) to show live progress.

One codebase, two roles (ps/worker) via env/CLI.

🔌 Network & Sync Design
Transport

Control plane (job start, register, dataset shards): FastAPI over HTTP/JSON.

Data plane (weights/gradients): WebSocket binary frames (low overhead) or gRPC streams.
We’ll default to WS for simplicity and Python-only stack.

Messages (binary payloads with small JSON header)

Header: { job_id, worker_id, msg_type, weight_version, base_version, num_params, dtype, encoding }

Body: raw bytes (possibly compressed/quantized).

Encodings: fp32, fp16, q8, q4, topk:<k%>, delta_rle.

Versioning & Staleness

PS maintains global_version (monotonic).

Worker keeps local_base_version (the version it last synced from).

Worker sends delta = w_local - w_base with the base_version.

PS applies deltas only if base_version ≥ global_version - τ, where τ = staleness window (e.g., 2).

If too stale, PS asks worker to resync now (send full weights or fetch new).

SSP (Stale Synchronous Parallel) semantics: ensures bounded drift while retaining async speed.

Aggregation Policy (micro-rounds)

Round window: PS starts a micro-round once it receives first delta for current version.

Quorum: aggregate when K of N deltas reached (e.g., K=ceil(0.6*N)) OR timeout hits (e.g., 50–150 ms).

Optimizer on PS: PS applies aggregated gradients (preferred) or deltas to global weights using centralized Adam/SGD state.

Immediate push: after update, PS emits WEIGHTS_UPDATE to all connected workers (push-first).

Workers apply fresh weights (or patch as delta) and continue.

Frequency

Worker forms micro-batches of 1–3 samples (configurable MICRO_BATCH=1|2|3) inside tf.data pipeline for throughput.

Adaptive throttle: if PS indicates high lag, worker increases micro-batch to reduce send rate.

🧪 Aggregation Algorithms (in ps/aggregator.py)

ASGD + SSP (default)

Workers send gradients; PS averages (weighted by seen samples) within the micro-round.

Centralized optimizer applies update once per micro-round.

FedBuff-style buffered async

Buffer multiple deltas per worker; aggregate on schedule for smoother PS utilization.

Top-k Gradient Sparsification

Keep top-k% magnitude entries; PS momentum correction to compensate bias.

8-bit quantization for dense updates

Per-tensor scale/zero-point; large savings with minimal accuracy loss.

Error feedback (residuals) on workers

Store quantization error and re-add next send to preserve convergence.

We’ll make each pluggable, controlled via .env or job params.

🗂️ Dataset Sharding

Django → PS with init_params including dataset stats and host root.

PS splits file list into N shards (balanced by class & size where possible).

Workers register → PS assigns shard URLs only (workers download locally).

Worker builds tf.data with: cached files, mixed precision, prefetch, small per-step MICRO_BATCH.

📡 API Surface (HTTP/JSON)

Base path: /api/v1

PS endpoints

POST /jobs/start/{job_id}
Request:

{
  "init_params": {
    "job_data": {
      "job_id": 123,
      "job_name": "job-123",
      "dataset_img": 45,
      "status": "QUEUED",
      "algo": "ResNet50",
      "user": 7,
      "parameter_settings": { /* from Django form */ }
    },
    "dataset_details": {
      "host_url": "http://datasets.local/",
      "files": [".../classA/a1.jpg", "..."],
      "num_classes": 2
    }
  }
}


Response: { "ok": true }

POST /workers/register
→ assigns worker_id, shard, WS endpoint, and training hyperparams (algo, lr, etc).

GET /jobs/{job_id}/status
→ for quick checks; also PS writes to DB.

Worker local endpoints (optional for debugging)

GET /healthz, GET /metrics

WebSocket topics

WEIGHTS_DELTA (worker→PS)

WEIGHTS_UPDATE (PS→worker)

RESYNC (PS→worker)

HEARTBEAT (both ways)

CONTROL (pause/resume/stop)

🧮 DB Integration (PostgreSQL)

Use psycopg pool (db/pg.py). Update public.train_training_job:

On job start: set status='RUNNING', started_at=now().

During training:

Update training_log (append last N lines) and training_log_history (rotate blobs).

Update parameter_settings (echo normalized config used).

Periodically write result as partial metrics JSON, e.g.:

{"step": 18400, "version": 512, "loss": 0.317, "acc": 0.914, "precision": 0.903, "recall": 0.889, "auc": 0.95}


On completion: set status='COMPLETED', ended_at=now(), result final metrics.

On failure: status='FAILED' and last error in training_log.

🔁 Worker Training Loop (concept)

Init: register → receive shard, hyperparams, and weights v0.

Stream: open WS to PS (bi-directional).

Loop:

Pull 1–3 samples from the shard (tf.data).

Forward + backward → gradient g.

Quantize/sparsify (e.g., fp16 or top-1%).

Send WEIGHTS_DELTA with base_version.

Do not apply optimizer locally (keep central state correct).

Listen for WEIGHTS_UPDATE and swap in global weights (or patch with delta).

If RESYNC, fetch full weights (or a compressed snapshot).

Adaptive: if lag>threshold, increase micro-batch to 3; if bandwidth low, raise ROUND_TIMEOUT_MS client-hint.

⚖️ Why this will beat the baseline

Per-micro-batch ASGD (not per-batch/epoch) → faster convergence feedback loops.

SSP limits divergence while keeping non-blocking workers (no hard barriers).

Central optimizer eliminates multi-optimizer drift (common accuracy killer).

Compression + sparsification keeps LAN traffic tiny, enabling very frequent updates.

Push-first updates reduce staleness vs periodic polling.

Quorum+timeout avoids straggler stalls but still captures majority signal.

🧰 Rollout Plan

Scaffold project (files above).

Implement wire schemas (Pydantic + binary framing).

Bring up PS HTTP + WS (no training yet).

Worker registration + dataset sharding (mock static list first).

Global weights store + central Adam (numpy/TensorFlow variables under PS).

Micro-round scheduling (quorum/timeout, SSP checks).

Worker gradient send + PS aggregate + push update.

End-to-end smoke test on LAN (1 PS, 2 workers).

DB reporting hooks (status & rolling metrics).

Compression & top-k toggles; residual error feedback.

Full integration with your Django start endpoint.

✅ Next: where to start?

If this plan looks good, I’ll start by drafting the first two files:

app/shared/config.py (env loading + validation, role selection)

app/api/schemas.py (HTTP contracts for job start & worker register)

Then we’ll wire up app/entrypoint.py to boot in ps or worker mode.
